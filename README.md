## GreenBin: An Innovative Waste Management System

GreenBin is an innovative waste management system that has been developed by our team in response to a successful waste campaign in our housing company. GreenBin aims to serve over 10,000 housing companies in Finland and motivate residents to increase their sorting rate and reduce waste generation, thus reducing costs and carbon emissions while promoting environmental sustainability.

The system includes a comprehensive reward system and ranking system that incentivizes residents to participate actively, making sorting waste more of a fun and engaging activity than a chore. Additionally, GreenBin is equipped with an AI-powered waste sorting assistant that ensures accurate waste sorting and minimizes the risk of contamination.

The financial benefits of GreenBin extend beyond cost savings; the money saved from reduced waste generation can be directed towards community projects that promote sustainability and social responsibility, enhancing the quality of life in our communities.

We are proud to say that GreenBin has received positive feedback from residents and has the potential to save millions of euros in the long run. We believe that GreenBin represents a significant step towards more sustainable waste management practices and can serve as a model for waste management systems worldwide.
